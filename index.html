        <p class="description">This year was a crazy year for my Media Arts class. COVID, no teacher, and many other different things put a twist into a lot of projects.
            but our class persevered through it. Before this year, I had very limited knowledge about graphic design and art in general, but this class has given me new opporotunities for the future.
            I also learned a lot about the different types of art, as we had units ranging through typography to vector to photography. One of the things I liked most about this class was the
            creativity involved. I had to really think about what I wanted it to look like and envision the project before I started. The more I advanced through the year, the more advanced
            I became and able to make exactly what I was envisioning. But something else about how great this class that isn't art related but instead the connections made throughout the projects.
            Since everyone was working on the same project at once, we got to reflect and help eachother with things which overall made everyones projects look more professional and creative.
            These culminations of things made this class one of my favorite of the year, and I will dearly miss the people and the class next year.
